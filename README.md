# UTSA-Course-Management-System
This program was developed during the Spring of 2021, and is meant to take an input of a binary .dat file compiled of classes in our course catalog at UTSA. 
Its inputs let you create courses, read courses, update courses, and delete courses. Its outputs are reflected by the choice that you choose.

How to run:
  1. make.
  2. run assign5.c using gcc.
